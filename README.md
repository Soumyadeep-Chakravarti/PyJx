# PyJx
PyJx is a Python library that provides seamless, Pythonic access to Java classes and methods. It abstracts JNI complexity, allowing Python code to call Java functions, handle data, and interact with objects with zero boilerplate, while leveraging stable memory pointers for high-performance, low-latency cross-language interop.
